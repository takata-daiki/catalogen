/* The pictures that GeomLab works with do not have a fixed size, but
 may be scaled uniformly to achieve any desired height or
 width.  Thus the aspect ratio (width/height) is fixed even if the
 size is not.  When two pictures are put side-by-side, there is a
 constraint that they should have the same height, and this removes
 one degree of freedom in the scaling; similarly when pictures are put
 one above another.  Each picture thus has a total of one degree of 
 freedom for scaling.
 
 Pictures are drawn in two layers: first the coloured fills, then
 black outlines over the top.  The colours used for the fills rotate
 as the pictures themselves are rotated: this makes Escher tilings
 work neatly. */
